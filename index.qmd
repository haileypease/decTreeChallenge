# 🌳 Decision Tree Challenge - Feature Importance and Variable Encoding

## Challenge Overview


## 🎯 The Key Insight: Encoding Matters for Interpretability

**The problem:** When we encode categorical variables as numerical values (like 1, 2, 3, 4...), decision trees treat them as if they have a meaningful numerical order. This can completely distort our analysis.

**The Real-World Context:** In real estate, we know that neighborhood quality, house style, and other categorical factors are crucial for predicting home prices. But if we encode these as numbers, we might get misleading insights about which features actually matter most.

**The Devastating Reality:** Even sophisticated machine learning models can give us completely wrong insights about feature importance if we don't properly encode our variables. A categorical variable that should be among the most important might appear irrelevant, while a numerical variable might appear artificially important.

:::

Let's assume we want to predict house prices and understand which features matter most. The key question is: **How does encoding categorical variables as numbers affect our understanding of feature importance?**

## The Ames Housing Dataset 🏠

We are analyzing the Ames Housing dataset which contains detailed information about residential properties sold in Ames, Iowa from 2006 to 2010. This dataset is perfect for our analysis because it contains a categorical variable (like zip code) and numerical variables (like square footage, year built, number of bedrooms).

## The Problem: ZipCode as Numerical vs Categorical

**Key Question:** What happens when we treat zipCode as a numerical variable in a decision tree? How does this affect feature importance interpretation?

**The Issue:** Zip codes (50010, 50011, 50012, 50013) are categorical variables representing discrete geographic areas, i.e. neighborhoods. When treated as numerical, the tree might split on "zipCode > 50012.5" - which has no meaningful interpretation for house prices.  Zip codes are non-ordinal categorical variables meaning they have no inherent order that aids house price prediction (i.e. zip code 99999 is not the priceiest zip code).

## Data Loading and Model Building

## Critical Analysis: The Encoding Problem

::: {.callout-warning}
## ⚠️ The Problem Revealed

**What to note:** Our decision tree treated `zipCode` as a numerical variable.  This leads to zip code being unimportant.  Not surprisingly, because there is no reason to believe allowing splits like "zipCode < 50012.5" should be beneficial for house price prediction. This false coding of a variable creates several problems:

1. **Potentially Meaningless Splits:** A zip code of 50013 is not "greater than" 50012 in any meaningful way for house prices
2. **False Importance:** The algorithm assigns importance to zipCode based on numerical splits rather than categorical distinctions OR the importance of zip code is completely missed as numerical ordering has no inherent relationship to house prices.
3. **Misleading Interpretations:** We might conclude zipCode is not important when our intuition tells us it should be important (listen to your intuition).

**The Real Issue:** Zip codes are categorical variables representing discrete geographic areas. The numerical values have no inherent order or magnitude relationship to house prices.  These must be modelled as categorical variables.

## Proper Categorical Encoding: The Solution

Now let's repeat the analysis with zipCode properly encoded as categorical variables to see the difference.

**Python Approach:** One-hot encode zipCode (create dummy variables for each zip code)

### Categorical Encoding Analysis

### Python

```{python}
#| label: categorical-python
#| echo: true
#| include: false
# One-hot encode zipCode
import pandas as pd

# Create one-hot encoded zipCode
zipcode_encoded = pd.get_dummies(model_data['zipCode'], prefix='zipCode')
model_data_cat = pd.concat([model_data.drop('zipCode', axis=1), zipcode_encoded], axis=1)

# Split data
X_cat = model_data_cat.drop('SalePrice', axis=1)
y_cat = model_data_cat['SalePrice']
X_train_cat, X_test_cat, y_train_cat, y_test_cat = train_test_split(X_cat, y_cat, test_size=0.2, random_state=123)

# Build decision tree with one-hot encoded zipCode
tree_model_cat = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=3, 
                                      min_samples_split=20, 
                                      min_samples_leaf=10, 
                                      random_state=123)
tree_model_cat.fit(X_train_cat, y_train_cat)

# Feature importance with one-hot encoded zipCode
importance_cat_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Feature': X_train_cat.columns,
    'Importance': tree_model_cat.feature_importances_
}).sort_values('Importance', ascending=False)

importance_cat_df['Importance_Percent'] = (importance_cat_df['Importance'] * 100).round(2)

# Check zipCode features
zipcode_features = [col for col in X_train_cat.columns if col.startswith('zipCode')]
zipcode_importance = importance_cat_df[importance_cat_df['Feature'].isin(zipcode_features)]['Importance'].sum()
total_importance = importance_cat_df['Importance'].sum()
zipcode_percent = (zipcode_importance / total_importance * 100).round(2)
```

### Tree Visualization: Categorical zipCode

### Python

```{python}
#| label: visualize-tree-cat-python
#| echo: true
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 6

# Visualize tree with one-hot encoded zipCode
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plot_tree(tree_model_cat, 
          feature_names=X_train_cat.columns,
          filled=True, 
          rounded=True,
          fontsize=8,
          max_depth=4)
plt.title("Decision Tree (zipCode One-Hot Encoded)")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### Feature Importance: Categorical zipCode

### Python
```{python}
#| label: importance-plot-cat-python
#| echo: false
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 5

# Plot feature importance for categorical zipCode
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
plt.barh(range(len(importance_cat_df)), importance_cat_df['Importance'], 
         color='darkgreen', alpha=0.7)
plt.yticks(range(len(importance_cat_df)), importance_cat_df['Feature'])
plt.xlabel('Importance Score')
plt.title('Feature Importance (zipCode One-Hot Encoded)')
plt.gca().invert_yaxis()
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```


## Discussion Questions for Challenge

**Your Task:** Add thoughtful narrative answers to these two questions in the Discussion Questions section of your rendered HTML site.

1. **Numerical vs Categorical Encoding:** There are two modelsin Python written above. For each language, the models differ by how zip code is modelled, either as a numerical variable or as a categorical variable. Given what you know about zip codes and real estate prices, how should zip code be modelled, numerically or categorically?  Is zipcode and ordinal or non-ordinal variable?

Zip code should be modelled as a categorical variable. Although it is written in a numerical format, you should not treat it as something that you can subtract from, find the mean of, etc. Each Zip Code ultimately represents a location and should be treated as a categorical variable. A zip code would fall under the category of being a non-ordinal variable.

2. **R vs Python Implementation Differences:** When modelling zip code as a categorical variable, the output tree and feature importance would differ quite significantly had you used R as opposed to Python. Investigate why this is the case.  What does R offer that Python does not? Which language would you say does a better job of modelling zip code as a categorical variable? Can you quote the documentation at [https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html) suggesting a weakness in the Python implementation? If so, please provide a quote from the documentation.

Well, when you model zip code as a categorical variable, R and Python behave very differently, and it in fact ends up affecting the entire structure of the tree. R is way more natural with this because it natively understands categorical variables through its factors, so it can split on different groups of zip codes in a way that reflects how housing markets really work. Python's decision trees don't do that out of the box. Instead, Python forces you to encode zip codes first, and once you do that, the tree starts making splits based on those encodings rather than actually understanding the real category. As a matter of fact, the scikit-learn documentation admits this limitation by saying, "the scikit-learn implementation does not support categorical variables for now." So in this case, R honestly does a better job because it handles zip codes the way they're supposed to be handled-without forcing you to hack around the model.

3. **Are There Any Suggestions for Implementing Decision Trees in Python With Prioper Categorical Handling?** Please poke around the Internet (AI is not as helpful with new libraries) for suggestions on how to implement decision trees in Python with better (i.e. not one-hot encoding) categorical handling.  Please provide a link to the source and a quote from the source.  There is not right answer here, but please provide a thoughtful answer, I am curious to see what you find.

If you're committed to staying in Python but want your decision tree to actually treat categories correctly, then you have to use tools outside of basic scikit-learn tree. Libraries like CatBoost, LightGBM, and H2O are specifically built to handle categorical variables without blowing them up into a million one-hot encoded columns. CatBoost even mentions that it can "convert categorical values into numbers using various statistics," which is a fancy way of saying that it handles categories intelligently instead of pretending they're ordered or numeric. Therefore, while Python's default tree doesn't get it right, there is definitely a way around it-you just have to use models that understand what a category is supposed to represent, especially on something like a zip code in the context of real estate.
